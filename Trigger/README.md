# Parametric Trigger

Many of my designs require the use of an input with smooth, precise motion, ideally with a durable, waterproof design.
This trigger design attempts to solve this problem as simply and cheaply as possible.

Note that this trigger is not for firearms. It's a gamepad-style component that can report a precise position, not an
on-off switch.

The hall effect sensor allows waterproof designs where the electronics are fully separate from the trigger mechanism
itself.

This project is heavily inspired by [monminiman's skateboard remote](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2800544/)
project. (Many thanks for publishing it!)
