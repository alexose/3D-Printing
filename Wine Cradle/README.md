# Victorian Wine Cradle

Welcome to the Victorian Wine Cradle project. This endeavor seeks to create a functional, 3D-printable Victorian wine
cradle. I was inspired to create this because antique versions of this unique accessory are hard to find, especially in
the New World. This project aims to allow everyone the ability to decant a bottle of old wine with the style and
elegance of an English butler.

The project is still a work in progress, but it provides the essentials of a Victorian wine cradle. Please note that
some assembly is required.

## Features

-   **Authentic Design**: Drawing inspiration from Victorian antiques, the design exudes elegance and refinement.
-   **3D Printable**: Making the wine cradle easily accessible to anyone with a 3D printer.

## Instructions

1. **Print the Parts**: Utilize your 3D printer to bring the design files to life.
2. **Assemble the Cradle**: Once printed, assemble the parts as per the provided guidelines.
3. **Enjoy Your Wine**: Decant your favorite vintage wine and enjoy it with added Victorian flair!

## Progress and Contributions

As the project is ongoing, suggestions and contributions are very welcome. If you have ideas or modifications that could
improve the design or functionality of the Victorian Wine Cradle, please feel free to share them.
