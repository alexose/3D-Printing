# Inner Tube Motor

An attempt to bring handheld outboard motors to the inner tube lifestyle.

Based on this [brushless thruster](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BVFCX4S/), these
[40A controllers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z68FP3W), and these
[servo testers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088KMG8DQ/), this project aims to make a handheld unit with
[self-contained batteries](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6080710).

## Well... does it work?

It does, actually! I made two of them, and I was able to scoot around on a lake from the comfort of my inner tube.

But, this prototype would be much improved with a trigger mechanism. This version only has a potentiometer that sticks
out of the top, which is hard ot adjust with one hand.

The other thing that I would work on would be the noise. These thrusters make a truly annoying noise. Not at all
condusive to true water relaxation.
