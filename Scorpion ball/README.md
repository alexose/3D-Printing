# Scorpion Ball

Welcome to the Scorpion Ball project! This fun, innovative venture allows you to create unique hollow spheres of ice
that can be filled with any liquid of your choice. Ideal for parties, BBQs, or just to impress your friends!

## Design Features

Scorpion Ball boasts a non-conventional design where each hemisphere screws together tightly, ensuring no leaks.
Included in the design are two handy wrenches for torquing down the assembly.

The project is fully 3D printable (supports are optional), except for a single 3.5" gasket (commonly found in water
filter canisters) which ensures a tight seal.

## Instructions

Here's how you can create your very own Scorpion Ball:

1. **Print Each Part**: This includes the bottom half, the inner shell, the outer shell, and the two wrenches. An infill
   of around 15% is recommended as the design benefits from being mostly hollow, allowing the sphere to freeze more
   evenly.

2. **Sand the Bottom Half**: Ensure that the mating surface of the bottom half is as smooth as possible.

3. **Insert the Gasket**: Place the 3.5" rubber gasket inside the groove located on the inner shell.

4. **Assemble the Shells**: Place the inner shell outside the outer shell.

5. **Screw the Halves Together**: Gently screw the two halves together using your hands, then use the included wrenches
   to apply additional torque.

6. **Fill the Sphere**: Fill the sphere via the hole in the top.

7. **Freeze the Sphere**: Place the sphere in your freezer. Every hour, poke a hole in the ice using a chopstick. This
   will keep the shell from exploding as the water freezes inside of it.

8. **Unmold and Refill**: After about five or six hours (the exact time depends on your freezer), turn the sphere upside
   down and drain the unfrozen water from the middle. Then, use a small funnel to refill it with a liquid of your
   choice.

9. **Unscrew and Enjoy**: Unscrew the shell and remove the ice sphere. Poke a straw through the hole in the sphere, hand
   it to a friend, and enjoy!
