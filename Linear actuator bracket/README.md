# Linear Actuator Bracket

This 3D printable bracket is specifically designed for use with the
[VEVOR 6" linear actuator](https://www.vevor.com/linear-actuators-c_11633/6-inch-stroke-linear-actuator-6000n-1320lbs-pound-max-lift-12v-volt-dc-motor-p_010577098364).

This project came into being to address a common issue with the cheap linear actuators: The included metal brackets can
bend over time, leading to operational problems. This sturdy, 3D printable bracket, when printed at 100% infill, offers
a robust and reliable alternative.

The bracket can be printed at various infill levels to adjust how breakable it is. This is useful in cases where you
need it to act as a mechanical fuse. For example, to break cleanly if someone tries to force open a gate or door.

## Installation

Designed for simplicity, the bracket can be easily secured onto a flat piece of wood using regular wood screws. This
straightforward installation allows the actuator to be firmly positioned, making it an ideal solution for applications
such as automatic gate openers.

## Instructions

1. **Print the Bracket**: Print the bracket design using your 3D printer. It's recommended to use 100% infill for
   maximum strength.

2. **Secure the Bracket**: Using standard wood screws, attach the bracket onto a flat piece of wood.

3. **Install the Actuator**: Place the VEVOR 6" linear actuator into the bracket.

4. **Secure the Actuator**: Ensure the actuator is firmly positioned within the bracket.

That's it! With these simple steps, you can enjoy a durable and reliable setup for your linear actuator.
