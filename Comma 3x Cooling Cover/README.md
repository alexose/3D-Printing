# Comma 3x Cooling Cover

This is meant to be printed out of PETG and painted with white cooling paint.  In theory this should allow the Comma 3x
to run cooler in hot and sunny environments.

Based on the excellent modelling work of [Likeablebump's carrying case](https://www.printables.com/model/467813-comma-3-carrying-case/files).
