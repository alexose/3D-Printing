# Dorothy - A Minimalist LoRa Sensor Platform

Dorothy is a minimalist, hackable, low-cost sensor platform built around the LoRa protocol. It uses the
[CubeCell V2](https://heltec.org/project/htcc-ab01-v2/) board and off-the-shelf sensors to deliver readings to a central
hub.

## Key Features

-   **3D Printable**: All components are fully 3D printable with no supports.
-   **Weatherproof**: Designed to live outside year round.
-   **Long Range**: Capable of a range of at least 1/4 mile (400m).
-   **Long Battery Life**: Designed for a battery life of one year.
-   **Easy to Assemble/Disassemble**: From the moment you're done printing, it takes about 20 minutes to assemble a
    working Dorothy, requiring minimal tools and skill. Just mount the components, screw it together, and
    you're set.
-   **Low Cost**: Around $25 per unit, including batteries
-   **Easy-to-read Codebase**: The codebase is designed to be compact and easy to understand.
-   **Open Licensing**: Dorothy comes with a fully open license.

## Assembly

**NOTE:** Soldering is required for the CubeCell board.

Dorothy is designed around the [Cylindrical Battery Holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6080710) project, allowing
easy swapping of cells. Alternatively, the whole battery can be quickly swapped in the field.

## Usage

To use Dorothy, follow the assembly instructions. Once assembled, the device should start transmitting data to the
central hub.
