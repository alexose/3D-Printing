# 3D Printable Battery Holder for 18650 Cylindrical Cells

![Project Image](/path/to/image.jpg)

## Description

This project is a fully 3D printable and functional battery holder designed primarily for 18650 cylindrical cells. The
design uses only filament and solid core wire. The design features threaded caps, allowing it to be screwed together
tightly to create a durable shell. Cells can be easily removed and replaced. Depending on the configuration of the wire
winding, the holder can be set up as either a series or parallel battery configuration.

As a bonus, this design is highly customizable, allowing it to hold more cells in a single container. It can be easily
modified to accommodate double or triple-stacked cells. By adjusting the parameters, it is possible to create a
symmetrical case for anywhere between one and 18 cells.

## Features

-   Fully 3D printable
-   Designed for 18650 cylindrical cells
-   Requires only filament and solid core wire. No springs or screws
-   Easy cell replacement
-   Highly customizable

## Prerequisites

-   3D Printer with any type of filament
-   Solid core wire

## 3D Printing Instructions

You can print the battery holder on any FDM 3D printer. Adjust your settings according to the specifications of your
printer and filament.

### Recommended Print Settings

-   Layer Height: 0.2mm
-   Infill: 15%
-   Supports: No
-   Raft/Brim: Not needed

## Assembly Instructions

1. Print all the parts using your 3D printer.
2. Cut the solid core wire into appropriate lengths for the battery contacts.
3. Thread the solid core wires through the designated slots in the battery holder.
4. Screw the components together using the threaded caps.

## Usage

To use, insert your 18650 batteries into the holder. The design ensures a secure fit and the solid core wire provides
the necessary electrical connections.

## Customization

By adjusting the design parameters, you can modify the holder to contain more cells in a single container, or to allow
for double or triple-stacked cells. This allows for a symmetrical case to be made for anywhere between one cell and 18
cells.
